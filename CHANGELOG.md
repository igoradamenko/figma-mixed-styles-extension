## 1.0.0 (06.04.2021)

First major release.

There's only one new feature — “Copy” button for code blocks.

Bugfixes:

1. Default values for rules won't be shown anymore.
2. `letter-spacing` sometimes was shown with a lot of numbers after decimal point. Now it's fixed.
3. `font-weight` and `font-style` wasn't parsed properly in rare cases.


## 0.1.0 (05.04.2021)

Initial version.
